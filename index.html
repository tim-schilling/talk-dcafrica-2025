One, is that we were the first town in America to have a kindergarten, which is a preschool class that helps children transition from home to school with an educational approach focused on singing, drawing and playing.

						Yeah, I don't get it either.

						Before we dive into the technical stuff, and in case people couldn't understand my Swahili from earlier, my name is Tim Schilling and I've been contributing to the Django community since 2014, starting with the django debug toolbar. I'm on the Django 6.x Steering Council, an admin for Djangonaut Space, an admin for Django Commons and I help maintain a few libraries. I've also been a navigator for a Djangonaut Space team and mentored a Google Summer of Code project. In the past I helped organize DjangoCon US, was secretary of DEFNA, helped answering questions on the forum and discord and was a moderator of the Django discord.
						<br /><br />
						I've always enjoyed helping people, but when I met the Django community in person in San Diego at DjangoCon US 2022, I began investing a lot of energy into the community.
						<br /><br />
						I hope with the rest of our time I can convince you that investing some of your time, energy and self into the Django community is a worthwhile investment.
						<br /><br />
						I'm going to start by sharing a bit about the community orgs I'm a part of. Steering Council, Django Commons and Djangonaut Space all are working to help contributors, but from different angles. Then we're going to shift gears and I'll share where you can get involved, how to decide where to invest your time and finish with why I think you should participate in the community.

						It's a group of five individuals that are elected every two years by the Django Software Foundation individual members. Steering Council elections coincide with the major version of the Django. The 6.x Steering Council consists of Carlton Gibson, Emma Delescolle, Frank Wiles, Lily Acorn and myself.
						<br /><br />
						The Steering Council is responsible for the technical aspect of the Django framework. We tend to be more focused on strategy and longer term concerns. However, we also exist to be the decision maker in cases where the community is unable to come to a consensus.
						<br /><br />
						This iteration of the Steering Council is a bit different than those in the past. We've been focusing a lot on the proactive parts of the role.

						We as a group believe that the third-party ecosystem is a powerful component of Django. It allows developers to quickly add massive amounts of functionality to their application so they can be more productive. It also acts as an outlet for the pressure to add more features to Django. All applications have different requirements, so it makes sense to allow people to choose which features. A vibrant third party ecosystem supports this by allowing people to effectively form groups to discuss, implement and iterate based on their needs.
						<br /><br />
						We on the Steering Council want to highlight the third-party ecosystem. We want to make it easier for new and old Django developers to find helpful packages. To do so, we've added our curated list of packages, resources and orgs to a page on the djangoproject.com website. We're working on adding additional content to the site to continue to highlight the ecosystem.

						Another thing we've been working on is improving the contributor experience. Specifically, the process to add new features to Django. We started a new flow for folks to suggest new features at the GitHub repo, github.com/django/new-features. We're hoping to provide more clarity to folks on how add a feature to Django. We have highlighted the various stages an idea will go through and what the gates are for it to move to the next one.
						<br /><br />
						One thing you as community members can do today is to visit that repository and share your ideas for Django. If you have an idea of something else Django should be able to do, please open an issue.
						<br /><br />
						Another thing you can do today is provide feedback on ideas. We have implemented a system where people can use the emoji reactions to indicate their preference without needing to comment. Letting folks know which ideas excite you or which you're not a fan of is extremely valuable to the community.  It allows us to focus our energy on those things that the community desires.

						Remember how I was talking about how important the third-party package ecosystem is to Django? Well this org seeks improve the maintenance experience for that ecosystem. So whereas the Steering Council is focused on strategy for the Django Community, Django Commons is focused on making the day to day aspect of third-party package maintenance better.
						<br /><br />
						How does this happen? We provide a home for community-maintained packages, making it easy to transition between maintainers. The org's admins manage the teams and permissions for each package. And we seek to automate the logistical actions as much as possible for projects. Right now that is only the releasing to PyPI. Though Rahmat Akintola is working on automating releases to Test PyPI making the release process is testable. As someone who tends to break the release process for his project, I'm really looking forward to that.

I'm really proud to say we've had Stars, what we call Djangonauts after they complete their mission, these stars have stick around to become future leaders. We've had stars be captains, session organizers and this last time, we had our first star be navigator.
						<br /><br />
						That's pretty special for me. The admin team wants to see Djangonaut Space get to a flywheel state, where it's self-sufficient and moves forward without outside input. Seeing all these people go through the program and then come back to help the next groups is incredibly moving.

The Working Groups currently accepting volunteers are: the accessibility team, code of conduct, fundraising, website, social media, and online community. You can find more information about each of these in their working group definitions on the dsf-working-groups repo on github.

Since meeting up in person is expensive, we should make a conscious effort to engage with one another online. We can do this whereever we feel most comfortable. For some people it'll be social media. For others, maybe the forum, WhatsApp, discord or Reddit. Sharing your thoughts and ideas, asking questions and answers others, it helps to connect our community.

						The last category is around content creation. There are several avenues you can take here in both subject and medium. You could write blog posts, create videos or start a new podcast. If you do any of which, please post about it on social media with the Django hashtag and share it on the forum or django discords. I want to hear about it. Your topics can be wide and varied. You could talk about the Django community, you could talk about your local community. You can talk about your favorite packages, or a particular difficult bug you solved. It doesn't have to be long, or frequent or the best. The community wants to see people try and we want to support each other.
						<br /><br />
						You can also create a community site. For example, Django News is a newsletter for django conent, Django Book is an aggregation of all the django books, and Django TV which is an aggregation of all Django video content.

					<h2>Where to invest your time?</h2>
					<aside class="notes">
						Okay, so at this point it should be clear that there's several places you could volunteer your time and impact our community significantly. If you're feeling overwhelmed by the number of opportunities, that's reasonable. There's a lot of choices and you should want to maximize your growth. So let's talk about how to decide where to invest your time.
					</aside>
				</section>
				<section data-auto-animate>
					<h2>Participate where the benefits for you most outweigh the costs</h2>
					<aside class="notes">
						You should participate in open-source where the benefits for you most outweigh the costs. The benefits are going to vary for person to person. They can be extrinsic, from outside forces or intrinsic, from within yourself. The costs are going to be easier to identify. They are stress, time, and energy. Time and energy are relatively fixed. You only have so much of it each day.

					<h3>"Know Your Limits: On Surviving Open Source" by Carlton Gibson</h3>
					<aside class="notes">
						Stress is a little variable. Over time, a person can learn to tolerate a lot of stress. We need to be careful in this regard because it's easy to say, "I'm taking on this stress because I don't want the next person to deal with it." This is warranted in some cases, but it shouldn't define your OSS journey. This should be fun after all!
						<br /><br />
						For more on this topic, please watch Carlton Gibson's talk, "Know Your Limits: On Surviving Open Source"
					</aside>
				</section>
				<section data-auto-animate>
					<h3>What are the benefits of OSS for you?</h3>
					<aside class="notes">
						Let's dive further into how to evaluate the benefits. We're going to need to do some self-reflection. You should consider the following questions:
					</aside>
				</section>
				<section data-auto-animate>
					<h3>Why are you participating in open-source?</h3>
					<aside class="notes">
						Why are you participating in open-source? Is it so you can find a job? Is it because your company depends on it? Do you just like writing code? Do you want your technical expertise to be seen and acknowledged? This is going to be specific to you.
						<br /><br />
						Nobody can tell you why you participate in open-source. However, understanding your why can make it easier for you to evaluate opportunities. For example, if you are maintaining a package only because your company relies on it, and then your companies shifts to a new language, that's probably a good reason for you to transition the package to another person. It's easier to recognize that need for transition if you understand why you were contributing in the first place.
					</aside>
				</section>
				<section data-auto-animate>
					<h3>What motivates you?</h3>
					<aside class="notes">
						The next question is, what motivates you? Are you the type of person who likes solving a technical problem? Or maybe you really enjoy structuring a library in the perfect way. Or maybe you're like me and you are motivated by helping and collaborating with others. For me, I've realized if an opportunity requires me to go it alone then I'm going to struggle with it.
					</aside>
				</section>
				<section data-auto-animate>
					<h3>What interests you?</h3>
					<aside class="notes">
						You should also ask, what excites/interests you? If you know that you find databases fascinating, try to find opportunities that puts you in contact with databases.
					</aside>
				</section>
				<section data-auto-animate>
					<h3>What skills do you want to learn?</h3>
					<aside class="notes">
						Lastly, consider what skills you want to learn. You're always going to learn new things contributing to open source. You should try to align those things to what you actually want to know. For example, if you want to learn how to do some basic graphic design, joining the social media team for a conference or a meetup will provide low risk opportunities. Or if you want to improve your debugging skills, helping people on the Forum, Discord or Stack Overflow is a great way to do that.
					</aside>
				</section>
				<section data-auto-animate>
					<h3>Look for alignment between your needs and the opportunity's outcomes</h3>
					<aside class="notes">
						The reason these questions are important is that it helps you evaluate what opportunities will keep you interested emotionally and helps you grow as a person. You're looking to identify alignment between your needs and the opportunity's outcomes. The greater the alignment, the more likely you're going to enjoy it. If the alignment is poor, over time you'll find that you have to summon the energy to contribute. In the worst case you could burn out, which can takes months or years to recover from. So please, for your own health, be selective about where you contribute.

					<h3>What opportunities are currently available?</h3>
					<div class="fixed-width-list">
						<ul style="margin-top: 1em">

						</ul>
					</div>
					<aside class="notes">
						Now that you have an understanding of what you're looking for in an opportunity, we need to take a look around the community to see which are available. Remember that list of roles and teams that need help? Only some of those are available right now.
						<br /><br />
						For example, the Board and the Steering Council have their members elected by the individual members of the Django Software Foundation. Then there are groups that select their own members such as the Security Team. Conferences tend to accept organizers all year, but most roles are set early on in the planning stage.
						<br /><br />
						Beyond the schedules of roles, there are requirements for some roles in the community. In order to be elected to a position, you need to be an active community member for a while. If that's you, please run!

							<li>Participate in conversations on Social Media</li>
						</ul>
					</div>
					<aside class="notes">
						If you're someone who is newer to the community, some entry level opportunities are:
						<br /><br />
						- Triage issues and/or contribute PRs for Django or popular packages<br />
						- Volunteer at the events and conferences you attend<br />
						- Write blog posts about your experiences<br />
						- Ask and answer questions on the Forum or Discord<br />
						- Participate in conversations on Social Media<br />
						<br /><br />
						Please remember, you don't have to do all these things. Though you should try to be consistent about your participation. I think a good frequency for most of these is monthly. If you write a blog post and participate in a few threads on the forum every month for a year, you will feel very connected to the Django community. You will start recognizing names and avatars. And people will start recognizing you.

					<h2>Over time, you'll find opportunities unique to you</h2>

						There's another reason to do things periodically while avoiding trying to do all the things. As you engage with communities on a regular basis, something cool will happen. You're going to start seeing the problems that need solving that nobody is working on. There's really no other way to find these other than to immerse yourself in the community and wait. I've seen it happen multiple times.
						<br /><br />
						My time answering help questions for Django lead to proposing a debugging tutorial for a conference. Maybe I would have eventually proposed it, but maybe not. It's certainly possible that the years I spent helping other debug their problems gave me the confidence I needed to teach others.

Xterm saw the need for this project while helping people. The clarity to recognize the problem only came because they were immersed in the Django Discord.

					<h2>The Lilian Method</h2>
					<h3 style="margin-top:10vh">Contribute where it helps you on <span style="text-decoration: underline">your journey</span></h3>
					<aside class="notes">
						The last thing I want to mention about choosing where to contribute is what my friend Lilian shared with me. She chooses how to contribute based on what that opportunity will teach her and if it help with a longer term goal. It's such a healthy, productive and positive way to approach open source. Its genius the more you think about it too.
						<br /><br />
						Eventually you're going to hit a hard challenge. Something that's going to make you ask, "is this worth it?". For example, if you're working on some small, weird bug, it's possible only a few dozen people will benefit from it being fixed.If we're only asking "is ask worth it?" based on the time spent and the number of people impacted, then we shouldn't work on it.
						<br /><br />
						However, if you factor in the knowledge gained, relationships built and the doors being opened while working on the issue, it's more likely that it is worth it.
						<br /><br />
						That's why Lilian's selection method is genius. It's designed to help move herself forward when she eventually hits those road blocks. She knows what she's working on is helping her learn more and that the journey is worth more than the bug being fixed. So when choosing where to contribute, be like Lilian.

					</aside>

				<section data-auto-animate>
					<h2>You'll learn from others</h2>
					<aside class="notes">
						I help with the package, django-simple-history where I learn from the other maintainer Anders / ddabble. He crafts code and PRs in a way that is easy to understand. Working with him exposes me to an expert's way of thinking, and he creates a friendly environment that's open to questions. With each interaction, I learn something new on how to be better myself.

					<aside class="notes">
						Then there is the friendship consideration. I've noticed that when I make friends in the community and then those friends excitedly write about a topic, I'm physically compelled to read it. I approach these topics with an enthusiastic and open mindset, which helps me learn the material quicker. It doesn't hurt I can ask the person several follow-up questions too.
						<br /><br />
						So I'm part of a co-writing group with Matthias Kestenholz and Sarah Abderemane. I know Matthias from maintaining the Django Debug Toolbar together and Sarah, well she's everywhere, not to mention she's here. This writing group is just us silently writing on a voice call every other week. I highly recommend this approach to writing if you struggle to make time for it. But anyway, because of that writing group, when Matthias writes about maintaining referential integrity in a JSON field, you can bet I'm going to read it. Or Sarah, publishes an accessibility checklist, I'm reading it and trying to figure out how to use it work. The more these two write, the more I learn.

						Beyond the technical growth, you will grow as a human too. My friend Velda Kiara who is in the front of the photo who I know through DjangoCon US and Djangonaut Space has taught me and continues to teach me to take the wins as they are and to stop undercutting them. My friend Jeff Triplett, seen in the back next to me,  I met through DjangoCon US. He has taught me how to look at things things from a more measured and holistic viewpoint.

					<aside class="notes">
						My friend Rachell Calhoun, who I met through Djangonaut Space, helped me improve as a community organizer and to find better ways to provide critical feedback. Specifically the action of calling people in place of calling people out. Calling people in is less likely to cause a person to shutdown entirely and more likely to result in the behavior you want.

					<h2>Natalia Bidart: Being more welcoming to others</h2>
					<aside class="notes">
						My friend Natalia Bidart who I met through DjangoCon US, has helped me focus more on being welcoming to others. Such as showing acknowledgement and gratitude towards all contributions as well as recognizing and reducing language that excludes people.
						<br /><br />
						So my advice to you is, if you're the type of person who wants to grow and get better, consider contributing to Django.

					<h2>It will help you in your career</h2>
					<aside class="notes">
						Contributing to open source will help you in your career. That is true, but it may not be true in the way we want. Contributing to open source is like participating in an internship. It's a lot of work and you don't realize how valuable it is until you're well into it.
						<br /><br />
						It's the entirety of the experience that's beneficial rather than any one specific thing. It exposes you to new ideas and concepts. It helps form good habits. It puts you in touch with people who can provide advice and feedback. Contributing to open-source is one of those things that becomes more valuable the longer you participate.

							<h4>A strong sense of community is correlated with better mental health</h4>

						My last argument is that you should contribute because it introduces you to other people and grows your network.
						<br /><br />
						*transition*
						Beyond the job opportunities they can provide, the lessons they can teach you and the mentorship others can offer, building friendships and connections is what gives you a sense of community. A strong sense of community is correlated with better mental health. It is associated with reduced symptoms of depression, anxiety and stress. That's pretty dang cool.
						<br /><br />
						Remember how I was telling you about my hometown and how it was an insulated experience. I had a large family that primarily stayed in that town. I didn't know many people outside of that community. The turning point for me was at DjangoCon US 2022 in San Diego. Being there, I felt like I was finally amongst my people. That experience paved the way for me to invest into the Django community and build deep, meaningful connections with the community.
						<br /><br />
						In fact, in preparation for this talk, I able to ask a few friends from across Africa to review my outline for cultural misunderstandings. It was important to me to ask people who I had built a connection with, people that I knew. It's a personal achievement of mine that I have friends across the globe who want to see me succeed. That win for me was only possible because the Django community strives to be open, welcoming and more diverse. Contributing allows each of us to grow personally by meeting new people from different cultures.

					<h2>What I want you to take away</h2>
					<div class="fixed-width-list">
						<ul>
							<li>Consistency and perseverance are key</li>
							<li>Self-reflect on your goals and desires</li>
							<li>Find alignment between your goals and OSS</li>
							<li>Engaging will reveal more opportunities</li>
							<li>You will learn and grow</li>
						</ul>
					</div>
					<aside class="notes">
						Alright, let's start wrapping this up.
						<br />Remember when contributing to open source consistency and perseverance are key.
						<br />With Django, there are several opportunities available to you across the community.
						<br />When reviewing those opportunities, self-reflect on your goals and desires.
						<br /><br />The more aligned the opportunity is with your own goals, the more engaged you will be and you'll be less likely to burnout.
						<br /><br />Over time, you'll start seeing underlying challenges the community is facing and opportunities unique to you will start appearing.
						<br /><br />As you contribute, you're going to learn from others and grow. Not only as a developer but as a human.
						<br /><br />You'll find people around the globe who want to see you succeed and cheer you on as you take on bigger and bigger challenges.
						<br /><br />
						And if you're like me, and you've never quite fit in. You might realize that this group of people, the Django community. Is the group of people who you've been looking for the whole time.
						<br />
						So when you're ready, come join us.
